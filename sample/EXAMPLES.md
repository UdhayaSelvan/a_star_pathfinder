A sample node drawing that can be solved using astar algorithm. Where the cost of the path (g(n)) is indicated in red and the h(n) is indicated in black numbers close to the node. Here the path A->B->G is the shortest as the f(n) for these nodes are the lowest.

The above picture is an example of how the A* algorithm calculates the path.

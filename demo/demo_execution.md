## Program execution
If you want to run the program you need **pygame module** installed in your computer. You can do that typing "pip install pygame" in your command window. You can get the program code from **.py_script** folder in the repository and use any python interpreter to run the code.
1. This program takes 3 inputs from left mouse button, one from the right mousebutton and one from the space key.
2. Once the Pygame window is open, you can start by adding the start node (by pressing down the **left mouse button** once).
3. Followed by the end node in another spot in the window (goal spot).
4. Once the start and end nodes are defined, you can set up the barriers by pressing down and holding the **left mouse button**.
5. And when you are satisfied with the barrier, you can press the **space key** once to start the algorithm.
6. If you made a mistake or if you want to remove a tile, you can do that just by pressing **right mouse button** once on the tile or hold the button and hover on the screen to bulk remove tiles.


I've added three videos in this folder demonstrating the program run. You can download and open the files (MP4).
